# Audio Player

Super simple audio player. It listens for lines over the serial port (the specific serial port and baud rate are set in `options.json`) and plays the audio file (if any) from the audio folder.

# Setup instructions

In your termial cd into the directory for this project and run `sudo node audio-player.js`.

If it is silently failing make sure that you don't have another tab open that is also running the above command.
